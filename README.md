1.1 Introduction

Jenkins is a common continuous integration server that allows developers to continuously release the latest version of the software to users with ease. Among the greatest problems developers encounter during this process is not being able to view the changes between each build in order to gain better understanding of whatâ€™s going, and thus can decide what strategies to take. For our project we aimed to rectify this problem with a plugin. Our plugin, Diff Build Plugin, is a product that enables the comparison of the Jenkins console outputs, POM dependencies, source codes, and Maven phases among different builds.
